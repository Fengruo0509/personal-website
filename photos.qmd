As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue across the sky, the rugged coastline transformed into a scene of tranquil beauty. The crashing waves added a dynamic element to the composition, creating a sense of movement and vitality in each frame. From secluded coves to expansive sandy stretches, each beach along the highway provided its own unique backdrop for capturing the magic of winter sunsets. As I drove along the winding roads, I couldn't resist stopping at various viewpoints to immortalize the scenes through my lens.
