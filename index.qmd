I am currently a senior year Statistics undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I have immersed myself in the rigorous academic curriculum and vibrant campus life. Originally from China, I made the courageous decision to pursue my education abroad since high school, seeking new opportunities and challenges to further enrich my learning journey. 

Feel free to connect with me on social media or explore more about my interests and adventures on my website. For further insights into my academic and professional journey, please feel free to review my [resume](Fengruo Zhang-Resume.pdf). If you have any inquiries or opportunities for collaboration, I can be reached via email at fzhang01@g.ucla.edu.
